You can get this masala easily at any Indian store. It’s a blend of spices like coriander, cumin seeds, fennel, cinnamon, amchur (dried mango powder) and more. I prefer Everest brand of pav bhaji masala, but you may use whatever you like!

To make pav bhaji masala, you would need:

4 tablespoons coriander seeds (20 grams)
2 tablespoon cumin seeds (18 grams)
5 dried red chilies (3-4 grams), adjust to taste
8 cloves
1 tablespoon fennel seeds (9 grams)
3 black cardamom
1 cinnamon stick, around 2 inches
1.5 teaspoon turmeric powder (6 grams)
2 teaspoon ground black pepper (6 grams)
1.5 tablespoon amchur (18 grams)
½ teaspoon ground ginger (1 gram)
2 teaspoon black salt (12 grams)
Dry roast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies, cloves, fennel seeds, black cardamom and cinnamon stick in a pan on medium heat until fragrant, around 3 to 4 minutes.

Let it cool and then transfer spices to a spice grinder. Stir turmeric powder, ground black pepper, amchur, ground ginger and black salt.
